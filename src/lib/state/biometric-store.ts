/**
 * Biometric Store
 *
 * Persists whether the user has enabled biometric (fingerprint / Face ID) app lock
 * AND/OR a PIN-only lock (for devices without biometric hardware).
 *
 * Lock-screen gating logic (used by AuthGate):
 *   • isBiometricEnabled — user enrolled biometrics; show fingerprint prompt on launch.
 *   • isPinEnabled        — user set a PIN (may be the sole method OR the biometric backup).
 *                           AuthGate shows the lock screen whenever EITHER flag is true
 *                           and the session is not yet unlocked.
 *
 * `isUnlocked` is ephemeral — it resets to false on every app launch so the user
 * must authenticate each time they reopen the app.
 *
 * `hasSeenFirstUnlockCelebration` is persisted so the joyful first-unlock animation
 * plays exactly once, ever.
 *
 * `needsPinReAuth` is persisted. Set to true when the OS reports that the enrolled
 * biometrics have changed (e.g. the user added/removed a fingerprint). The app will
 * require a successful PIN entry before re-registering the new biometric state.
